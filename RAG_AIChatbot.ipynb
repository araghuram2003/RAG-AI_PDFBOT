      "\n",
      "3.7.1 Vitamins and Minerals as Supplements\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, multivitamin, multimineral, vitamin, and mineral supplements are the most widely used dietary supplements (Bailey et al. 2013).\n",
      "\n",
      "Although adequate intake of these micronutrients is required to maintain optimal health, the possibility of toxicity increases with increasing dose (Mulholland and Benford 2007).\n",
      "\n",
      "Because dietary micronutrient deficiency is increasingly rare in developed countries, most supplement consumers actually have excess vitamin and mineral intake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the wide availability of fortified foods, many people still consume supplements (EUFIC 2009).\n",
      "\n",
      "Vitamins and minerals are essential for maintaining optimal health, and deficiencies can lead to various health problems (WHO 2003).\n",
      "\n",
      "Some classes of supplements, their examples and contents are presented in Table 3.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vitamins and minerals can also be found in foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats (EUFIC 2009).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the modern diet often lacks essential vitamins and minerals, making supplements a popular choice (Kourkouta et al. 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "Vitamin and mineral supplements can be beneficial for people with specific nutritional needs, such as vegetarians or vegans (Bailey et al. 2013).\n",
      "\n",
      "The main reason for the low efficiency of some supplements is their manufacturing method and the source of their basic substances (Rovira et al. 2013).\n"
